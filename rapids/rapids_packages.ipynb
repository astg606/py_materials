    "- Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are custom designed to be very efficient at handling computer graphics and image processing.\n",
    "- GPUs are designed to handle billions of repetitive low level tasks, like arithmetic operations.\n",
    "- Central Processing Units (CPUs) handle computations serially, meaning the logic in handled in one stream: the next task will complete when the subsequent task has finished. CPUs can execute tasks in parallel across cores. For example, most computer CPUs tend to have either two, four or six cores.\n",
    "- In comparison, GPUs have hundreds of 'cores'. This massively parallel architecture is what gives the GPU its high compute performance.\n",

    "- Compared to the CPU, the GPU is specialized for compute-intensive, highly parallel computation - exactly what graphics rendering is about - and therefore designed such that more transistors are devoted to data processing rather than data caching and flow control.\n",
    "- The GPU is especially well-suited to address problems that can be expressed as data-parallel computations - the same program is executed on many data elements in parallel - with a high ratio of arithmetic operations to memory operations.\n",
    "- Because the same program is executed for each data element, there is a lower requirement for sophisticated flow control, and because it is executed on many data elements and has high arithmetic intensity, the memory access latency can be hidden with calculations instead of big data caches.\n",

    "\n",
    "- GPU programming is the use of a GPU together with a CPU to accelerate computation in applications traditionally handled only by the CPU.\n",
    "- Parallel computing platforms allow us to write codes to be executed on GPUs:\n",
    "   - **Nvidia’s CUDA** (Compute Unified Device Architecture): can be called within  C, C++, Fortran, or Python codes without any skills in graphics programming. \n",
    "   - **OpenCL**: The most popular open, royalty-free standard for cross-platform, parallel programming. OpenCL defines a C-like language for writing programs, but third-party APIs exist for other programming languages and platforms such as Python or Java.\n",
    "   - **OpenACC**: Designed for scientists and engineers interested in porting their codes to a wide-variety of heterogeneous HPC hardware platforms and architectures. It used by annotating C, C++, and Fortran source code to tell the GPU which areas that should be accelerated.\n",
    "- A GPU program comprises two parts: \n",
    "   - a host part that runs on the CPU, and \n",
    "   - one or more kernels that run on the GPU. \n",
    "- Typically, the CPU portion of the program is used to set up the parameters and data for the computation, while the kernel portion performs the actual computation. \n",
    "- In some cases the CPU portion may comprise a parallel program that performs message passing operations using MPI.\n",
