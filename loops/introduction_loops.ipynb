    "- A loop in a computer program is an instruction that is executed over and over again until a specified condition is reached. \n",
    "- The purpose of loops is to repeat the same, or similar, code a number of times (process is called **iterations**).  This number of times could be specified to a certain number, or the number of times could be dictated by a certain condition being met. \n",
    "- A loop usually has one or more of the following features:\n",
    "    - A **counter**, which is initialized with a certain value — this is the starting point of the loop.\n",
    "    - A **condition**, which is a true/false test to determine whether the loop continues to run, or stops — usually when the counter reaches a certain value. \n",
    "    - An **iterator**, which generally increments the counter by a small amount on each successive loop, until the condition is no longer true.\n",
