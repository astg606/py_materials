    "- **Explanatory visualizations** bring the results to the forefront; they convey the author’s hypothesis or argument to the reader.\n",
    "- **Exploratory visualizations** encourage the user to explore the data or subject matter to uncover findings for themselves.\n",

    "- An open-source Python package or data analysis and visualization. It is designed to make plotting easy and interactive. \n",
    "- **It is not a plotting library**: it lets you build data structures that are conducive to visualization.\n",
    "- Once you move your data into a HoloView Container object,  you can explore the data visually.\n",
    "- It connects your data to plotting code implemented in other packages, such as Matplotlib, or Bokeh. Plotting happens separately on the Matplotlib or Bokeh backends, so you can focus on the data, not writing plotting code.\n",
    "- Allows you to collect and annotate your data in a way that reveals it naturally, with a minimum of effort needed for you to see your data as it actually is.\n",
    "- Designed to package your data to make it maximally visualizable and viewable interactively.\n",
    "- Can allow you to store, index, slice, analyze, reduce, compose, display, and animate your data as naturally as possible.\n",
    "- Makes your numerical data come alive, revealing itself easily and without extensive coding.\n",
    "- Support streaming data and many data formats (Pandas, Dask, Xarray, etc.)\n",

    "- **The Element type**. Encapsulates your data to indicate how your data can be analyzed and displayed (image, curve, point plot, etc.). Elements are the HoloViews' most basic, core primitive. They always preserve the raw data they are supplied.\n",
    "- **Dimensions of your data**. Provide information on the dimensions (name, values, etc.) associated with the data. This allows HoloViews to rescale and label axes and allows HoloViews be smart in how it processes your data.\n",
    "- **The multi-dimensional space in which your data resides**. Might be spatial coordinates, spatial position of one component relative to another, or an abstract space. \n",
    "- **How your data should be grouped for display**. Describes how you want your data to be organized for visualization. \n"
