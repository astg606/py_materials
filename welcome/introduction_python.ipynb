    "* Is easy to learn. Its code has a very ‘natural’ style to it, in that it is easy to read and understand.\n",
    "* Supports multiple programming paradigms including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming and procedural styles\n",
    "* Interoprates with other languages such as Fortran, C, C++, Java,...\n",
    "* Is a great General Purpose Language capable of creating anything from desktop software to web applications and frameworks.\n",
    "* Runs on any platform.\n",
    "* Has a very extensive standard library and over 150,000 external libraries.\n",
    "* Has a large community.\n",
